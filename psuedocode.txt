PROGRAM: User Input Read/Write Program
-	This program takes a string input from a user and stores it in a file "CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt".
    The program reverses the values of the contents of the file "CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt" and stores it in "CSC450_CT5_mod5-reverse.txt".

BEGIN
    BEGIN
        declare a "read_file" function that takes an absolute file path parameter and returns the content of the file as a string
        declare a "write_file" function that takes a value(the data to be written), an absolute file path and a file write mode as parameters.
                The function will write the data to the file in the given mode(append or overwrite).
        declare a "str_reverse" function that takes a string parameter and returns the reversed string. Make sure the initial string is not mutated.
        declare a "get_input" function that prompts a user to enter a string and returns the string.
                The function takes one argument: a string "instruction" to tell the user what to enter.
    END

    declare a "save_input" function that
            takes a user's input using the "get_input" function
            reads the contents of the "CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt" file using the "read_file" function
            appends the input to the file using the "write_file" function
    declare a "save_reversed_file_content" function that
            reads the contents of the "CSC450_CT5_mod5.txt" file using the "read_file" function.
            reverses the file contents.
            saves the reversed string to the "CSC450_CT5_mod5-reverse.txt" file using the "write_file" function.
            the contents of the "CSC450_CT5_mod5-reverse.txt" file should be overwritten.
    declare a main function to run the program.
        inside the main function:
        - call the "save_input" function
        - call the "save_reversed_file_content" function
END
